Hello\! My name is Realizm, and I am a passionate programmer with a love for computers. I have been programming for 5 years and am always eager to try new things and expand my skill set.

I started my journey in programming because of my fascination with technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. Over the years, I have worked on various projects that have helped me grow both technically and creatively.

Some of my notable projects include:

* Roblox Scripting: I have 5 years of experience in Lua programming, specializing in game mechanics, UI systems, and Datastore management. My work includes combat systems, custom admin panels, and economy systems, all aimed at creating engaging and efficient gameplay experiences.

* Discord Bots: I have coded several Discord Bots that enhance user experience and automate tasks.

* Sales Website: I created a sales website for my mother, which, although no longer active, was a valuable learning experience.

* Roblox Exploits (Past Work): I previously developed Roblox exploits, which helped me gain a deep understanding of game security and anti-cheat systems.

Beyond my technical skills, I am known for my curiosity and adaptability. I believe that exploring new areas is essential for growth, and I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities.

When I’m not programming, I enjoy gaming, watching anime, and driving my car. These hobbies help me stay creative and inspired I’m excited about the future and the possibilities it holds.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to the possibility of working together and contributing to your next exciting project\!

Best regards,  
Realizm
